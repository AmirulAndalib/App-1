If you're using our mobile app, you can also message us through the chat bubble in the top right corner. Alternatively, click your user icon on the web app to find the 'Help and Feedback' option. We're here to help!

## Concierge

Concierge is your personal assistant for managing expenses and is accessible through chat, ready to assist you whenever you need support! It's here to help you create expenses, submit finished reports, and even assist with approvals. It's like having a virtual helper who can also handle employee reimbursements. The more you use Concierge, the better it becomes at making your expense process smoother.

## Your Setup Specialist

Expensify provides phone support for anyone through a Setup Specialist! Your dedicated Setup Specialist can be reached at new.expensify.com using our powerful chat tool. 

# What to Expect from your Setup Specialist:

- Personalized Support

Your Setup Specialist is here to assist you with tailored support. They can answer your questions and arrange screen share calls to help you set up your Expensify account or familiarize you with the product.

- Product Demos

Are you curious about how the Expensify Card works or how it integrates with your accounting software? Just let your Setup Specialist know, and they'll guide you and your team through any feature you'd like to explore.

- Setup Assistant 

You don't have to do it alone when setting up your Expensify account. When you're ready to begin, chat with your Setup Specialist in the #admins room. They'll ensure everything is configured correctly right from the start.

## Account Managers

If you have more than ten active users, your Account Manager will pick up where your Setup Specialist left off at the end of your official onboarding. Your account manager is a dedicated point of contact to support Workspace admins with questions about their Expensify account. They are available to help you and other Workspace admins review your account, advise on best practices, and make changes to your Workspace on your behalf whenever you need a hand. They will actively monitor open technical issues and be proactive with recommendations to increase efficiency and minimize time spent on expense management.
Unlike Concierge, an account manager’s support will not be real-time, 24 hours a day. Your account manager will be super responsive when online, but anything sent when they’re offline will not be responded to until they’re online again.

**For real-time responses and simple troubleshooting issues, you can always message our general support by writing to Concierge via the in-product chat or by emailing [concierge@expensify.com](mailto:concierge@expensify.com).**

# FAQ

## Who gets an account manager?

Customers with ten or more paid subscribers are automatically assigned a dedicated account manager. If you have fewer than ten active users each month, you won’t have an account manager until your subscription is increased to 10 or more users. To be assigned an account manager immediately, log into your Expensify account and go to Settings > Workspaces > Group, then click Subscription and increase your subscription size to 10 or more.

## How do I know if my account manager is online?

You can see if they are online via their status in new.expensify.com, which will say something like “online” or have their working hours listed.

## What if I’m unable to reach my account manager?

If, for some reason, you’re unable to reach your account manager, then you can always reach out to Concierge for assistance. Your account manager will always reply when they’re online again.

## Can I get on a call with my account manager?

Of course! You can ask your account manager to schedule a call whenever you think one might be helpful. We usually find that the most effective calls deal with general setup questions. We typically recommend chat for technical troubleshooting as that allows your account manager time to look into the issue, test things on their end, and consult the wider Expensify technical team if needed. It also allows you to refer back to instructions and links quickly.

## When should I chat with Concierge instead of my Setup Specialist?

You can chat with Concierge via the chat icon in your Expensify account or at new.expensify.com for quick responses. Personalized support, while thorough, may only sometimes be immediate.

**#admins** - every Workspace admin will be invited to this room by default.

## Can I change the notification settings?

Unlike direct messages, rooms have three notification settings. Members can adjust this room-by-room by clicking the chat header and accessing the Details page on the right-hand side.

- **Daily** (enabled by default) - A daily digest of all email/SMS messages is sent at 9 am in the member’s local timezone, summarising all the unread messages in the room that were missed in the previous 24-hour window.
- **Always** - Push notifications are sent in real time, adding an email/SMS fallback for any chats missed in the previous 10 minutes.
- **Mute** - Push notifications and email/SMS fallback notifications are not sent at all.
